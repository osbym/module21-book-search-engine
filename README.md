## Installation 
For installation the user should clone the repository from GitHub and install dependencies. Run `npm install` on both client and the server directory to install dependencies. You will find two servers for the client and server side, which in theory can be run independently. To run both servers at the same time, open the root directory and run `npm start`.

## Usage 
This project is still a work in progress but it's intended to allow users to search for books and view up to 10 results. Users can also sign up and login in. Logged in users can save a book and view a page of saved books. Users can also remove books from their saved page as well.
